# User_Account-work-flow
The Java code is about how to implement a simple work flow system. The use-case of interest here is for users to submit requests for new user accounts.  When the user account request is received by the system administrator and upon review of the request, the system administrator creates the user account on behalf of the user. The sys admin can choose to reject a request and therefore an account is not created. I have designed two roles: one for the system administrator and one for a person. If the person infomation is not in the person directory then the admin will create the person object first and that will be followed by the user account. The user can see the status of their request and if the user account was created. To test the system, the user will be allowed to login and see if he can login or not. And if he is approved, then the user work area is created and displayed.
